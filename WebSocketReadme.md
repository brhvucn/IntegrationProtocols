# Websockets
This is a simple implementation of communication using WebSockets. The server will randomly send messages to the client and the client will show them. From the client you may also send messages that are received by the server and returned. This project uses the NuGet package `Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebSockets`.

Alternative to manually use WebSockets is to use SignalR.
