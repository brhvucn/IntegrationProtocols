# GraphQL
This implementation in C# uses the HotChocolate NuGet packages. Inside the HotChocolate NuGetPackages there is a small too to act as a client to help you browse the data and query it, please refer to `/graphql` endpoint for this browser. Please refer to [The documentation](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/v13/get-started-with-graphql-in-net-core) for how to get started with this.

Also, there is a small client in vanilla Javascript to showcase how this is used in practice.
